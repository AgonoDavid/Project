          <h3> Gavi wins 2022 Kopa Trophy, surpassing Eduardo Camavinga and Jude Belligham</h3>
          <p>The best player under the age of 21 for 2022. That is the award that has been given to Bar√ßa midfielder Gavi at this year's Ballon d'Or gala. The 18 year old received the prize after an excellent season in 2021/22 in which he became a fixture in the blaugrana midfield. The Andalusian arrived at the club to join the youth teams but soon his talent and character led him to the first team where this season's Kopa Trophy is recognition of his arrival amongst the world's footballing elite.</p>
